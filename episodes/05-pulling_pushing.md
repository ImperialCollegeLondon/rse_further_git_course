title: "Pulling and Pushing"
teaching: 10
exercises: 5
questions:
- "How do I keep my local branches in sync with the remote branches?"
- "What is the difference between forking and branching?"
objectives:
- Push changes to a remote repository.
- Pull changes from a remote repository.
keypoints:
- With `git push` you can push any committed changes in your current branch to its upstream branch.
- If the current branch has no upstream yet, you can configure one by doing `git push -u origin BRANCH_NAME`.
- Using `git pull` will bring changes in the upstream branch to the local branch.
- If the local and upstream branches have diverged (have different commit history), then `git pull` will attempt to merge both. If there are conflicts, you will have to resolve them.

## Multiple remote branches

Just as you can have multiple local branches, you can also have multiple remote branches. These may or may not be upstreams for your local branches.

As a reminder, remote and local repositories are not automatically synchronised, but
rather it is a manual process done via `git pull` and `git push` commands. This
synchronisation needs to be done **branch by branch** with all of those you want to keep
in sync.

### Pushing

* Its basic use is to synchronise **any committed changes** in your current
 branch to its upstream branch: `git push`.
* Changes in the staging area will not be synchronised.

."){:class="img-responsive"}
* If the current branch has no upstream yet, you can configure one by doing
`git push --set-upstream origin BRANCH_NAME`, as done with `main` in the example
 below. The `--set-upstream` flag can be replaced by a shortcut `-u`. So you can
 use `git push -u origin BRANCH_NAME` instead.

 upstream yet."){:class="img-responsive"}
* `push` only operates on your current branch. If you want to push another
 branch, you have to `checkout` that branch first.
* If the upstream branch has changes you do not have in the local branch, the
 command will fail, requesting you to pull those changes first.

Let's try to push changes to the `main` branch. First make sure you are on the `main` branch.

```sh
git switch main
```
{: .commands}
```
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 6 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
```
{: .output}

Notice that git is suggesting you to use `git push` to publish your local commits. Let's do that:

```sh
git push
```
{: .commands}
```

> You should now be on the `main` branch. Try switching to the `spicy`

>
> 1. Check the current branch using `git branch`.
> 1. If the current branch is `main`, then switch to `spicy` using `git switch spicy`.
> 1. Push changes to the `spicy` branch using `git push`.

## Pulling

* Opposite to `push`, `pull` brings changes in the upstream branch to the local branch.
* You can check if there are any changes to synchronise in the upstream branch by
  running `git fetch`, which only checks if there are changes, and then `git status` to
  see how your local and remote branch compare in terms of commit history.
* It's best to make sure your repository is in a clean state with no staged or unstaged
  changes.
* If the local and upstream branches have diverged - have different commit history - the
  command will attempt to merge both. If there are conflicts, you will need deal with
  them in the same way described above.
* You can get a new branch that exists only in `origin` directly with `git switch
  BRANCH_NAME` which will automatically create a local branch with the same name
